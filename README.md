# tictaktoe-python

My first project on Python which is a TikTakToe game,

1.  Two player needs to be able to play this on the same computer,
2.  First Player is asked to choose between O or X,
3.  If the first player chooses O, it means the second player will use X,
4.  Both players will choose what index to put the O/X.
5.  If one of the players qualifies to win, the system will tell it.
